# <p align="center">The Neural Nexus</p>
## <i>Explore. Build. Master Neural Networks.</i>

The Neural Nexus is a repository for exploring and showcasing neural network architectures. From foundational models 
like feedforward and convolutional networks to advanced techniques like transformers and generative models, it serves as 
a central hub for all things neural—your gateway to mastering deep learning and cutting-edge designs.

### Note
Deep learning models typically require many epochs for meaningful results, but without a GPU or cloud resources, 
training is time-consuming. To focus on showcasing architectures and experimentation, most models here are trained for 
very few epochs, prioritising exploration over accuracy.
